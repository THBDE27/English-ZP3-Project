    Swimming is a sport that asks a lot. Dedication or training, both are required extensively to reach the top speeds in this sport. There aren’t many swimmers that are able to reach the top of swimming, which is to be expected because some of the best swimmers are helped a lot with genetics which favor them. Micheal Phelps and Grechen Walsh are the male and female athletes that come to mind, these two are the pinnacle of the swimmers in their respective genders and events. They’ve gone through a lot to be where they are right now but as mentioned earlier, they do have amazing genetics which help them reach some of the highest speeds ever recorded. These athletes are the peak of the sport, and we’re going to dive in their histories, what’d they do to reach that point, what genetics favors them and why they’re known in the swimming world.
