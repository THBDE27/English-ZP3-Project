# English ZP3 Project



## 1. Context

### Backbone

We want to informe and inspire people about swimming. By sharing the technology that enables swimmers to be faster and to break records, we want to make people interested in swimming. Whether they are an experienced swimmer who wants to improve or a beginner who want to dive in, we will provide information to guide them on their swimming adventure.

### Audience

Our audience is teens to young adults who want to explore a new sport or to know more about swimming. It is also targeted to people who want to build lifelong habits. In fact, studies show that teenagers who play sports are eight times more likely to play sports in their mid-twenties than teens who do not.

### Domain

This project involves sports and how science and technology are used to optimize them. It also involves health and biology and since our final product is going to be a website, our project also involves programming.


## 2. Need

### Source

Despite being one of the top 3 events at the Olympics, swimming is a sport that really isn't talked about, even though it is an important skill to acquire. As a survival skill, as a hobby, or even as a form of entertainment, it is deeply underrated and deserves more recognition.

### Analysis

The problem stems from the fact that swimmnig is truly an incredible sport and needs more recognition, because it's a sport that is accessible fro anyone that wants to take a part for it, isn't that expensive conosidering that all infrastructures are public and it is a sport that we can practice all year round.

### Relevance

The reason swimming has reached the top 3 in the Olympics is thanks to technology. Swimming has come so far since more technologies were introduced in sports, to the point that it was able to compete with athletics and gymnastics. Technology has helped with more accurate measure to optimize performance and analyze techniques, which has made the sport more accessible and exciting for a wider audience thus increasing its popularity in the Olympics.
