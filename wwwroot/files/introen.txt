Swimming is a sport where every detail counts, as much from a biological perspective to a physical perspective. It is a sport that has greatly evolved from its beginnings and that has become very competitive, making the margin of error smaller. Every athlete works hard to get those missing milliseconds; to win and to be the one with their hand on the wall first.  Some athletes naturally have a genetical advantage, but many other factors have made the sport of swimming more advanced and faster.  For high-level athletes, understanding their own biological advantages and the new rising technologies is essential to beat their own records and to even beat records on the international level. Considering the rise in popularity that swimming has been getting in the past couple of years, these technologies and scientific aspects are relevant and important to know to realize just how much the sport of swimming has evolved. It is interesting to learn how swimming has gotten faster and why swimming is so much faster now.
