Backstroke is the only competitive swimming stroke performed on the swimmer’s back. It is also the second slowest stroke, after breaststroke. Because the face always remains above the water, swimmers can breathe freely and maintain a steady rhythm. However, one of the main challenges in backstroke is maintaining a straight line and consistent direction without visual reference to the pool bottom or lane markings. The stroke requires excellent shoulder flexibility, core stability, and rhythm.

Each phase activates a different set of muscles, many of which are the same as those used in freestyle, though there are some key differences due to body orientation and movement direction.

· Hand entry

During the hand entry phase, the swimmer’s hand enters the water little finger first, fully extended. The multiples wrist flexor muscles help stabilize the hands and forearms and keep them in the best position.

· Catch

When the hand enters the water and prepares to pull, you need to activate your lower and middle back muscles (latissimus dorsi and trapezius), your chest muscles (pectorals) and your arm muscles (biceps and triceps) to bend your elbow to prepare for the pull.

· Pull

During the pull, the latissimus dorsi are the muscles that provide a lot of the pulling power, the deltoids are also important in order to lift and rotate the arms. The arm muscles (biceps and triceps) are also used to provide power to the pull. You also need the trapezius and rhomboids to stabilize the shoulder blades throughout the movement. This stability is essential to maintain efficiency and reduce the risk of shoulder strain.

· Recovery

In backstroke, recovery is usually done with straight arms. The deltoids are used to raise the arms high above the water, the triceps extend the elbow as the arm gets out of the water, and the rotator cuff muscles control the shoulder rotation and stabilize the movement.


The legs

The kick in backstroke is the same as in freestyle, which is flutter kick, an up and down alternating motion with straight or slightly bent legs. Kick provides propulsion, helps with the rotation of the body and improves body position. Since most people have their hips and feet sinking in the water when they are swimming on their back, kick is important to keep these at the surface which reduces drag. Though not the main source of propulsion, a well-timed and consistent kick improves balance, reduces drag and maintains horizontal body position. The kick can be split in two movements: the downbeat and the upbeat.



· Downbeat (kick downward):

When the leg goes downward through the water, the hamstrings and the gluteal muscles (glutes) power the movement. In backstroke, these muscles work harder than they do in freestyle since the swimmer is on their back which require greater effort to stay at the surface and stay aligned.


· Upbeat (kick upward):

The hip flexors and quadriceps move the leg toward the surface. The hamstrings flex the knee slightly and the gluteus maximus (glutes) helps lift the leg to the surface. The gastrocnemius and the soleus (calf muscles) are also used to maintain the ankles extended and the toes pointed but it is also important that the muscles in your shins (tibialis anterior) to be flexible and supple which will allow your feet to push effectively against the water.


Body position

The abdominal muscles are key, they help the overall body position and the rotation. You need your abdominal muscles, and your obliques to keep the body at the surface. Your core is going to be engaged through the whole movement the stay afloat. You also need to keep the spine straight and rotate it lengthwise. To do this, you need to use your internal and external obliques, your erector spinal, your rectus abdominal and other small spinal muscles. These muscles help stabilize the spine during rotation.
