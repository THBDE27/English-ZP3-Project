The muscles used in swimming
Swimming is built around four principal strokes: freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly. While all strokes engage the entire body and share muscle groups, each has unique movements and muscular demands.

Freestyle
Let’s begin with the stroke most people are familiar with freestyle, which is also known as crawl. Although it may appear simple, freestyle is a complex stroke. It is the fastest and the most efficient stroke in competitive swimming. Executing it correctly requires precise coordination and strength across the entire body, form the shoulders, to the legs and to the core and the back. Whether you're a competitive swimmer or a beginner, understanding which muscles are at work improve both your technique and performance.
Full-Body Engagement in Freestyle
Swimming freestyle involves a continuous, alternating movement of the arms and a flutter kick with the legs, supported by a strong and stable core. Roughly 90% of the propulsion comes from the upper body, especially the shoulders and back, with the remaining 10% from the legs. However, while the arms provide power, the legs and core are vital for balance, alignment, and effective movement.

The Arm Movement
The arm stroke in freestyle can be split into four phases:
1.	Hand Entry
2.	Catch
3.	Pull 
4.	Recovery
Each phase involves a different set of muscles:
•	Hand entry
The multiples muscles in the wrist help stabilize the hands and keep them in the best position.
•	Catch
As the hand enters the water and prepares to pull, swimmers activate their pectorals (chest muscles) and the latissimus dorsi and trapezius which are large upper and middle back muscles.
•	Pull
This is where most of the forward motion is generated. Swimmers use their shoulder adductors, extensors and internal rotators to provide the stroke power and their latissimus dorsi and serratus anterior for propulsion. They also use their biceps and triceps for elbow flexion and extension. They use their shoulder muscles (rotator cuff and deltoids), their middle back muscles (trapezius) and their rib cage muscle (serratus anterior) to stabilize and rotate the shoulder.
•	Recovery 
When the arm exits the water and swings forward, deltoids, trapezius, and rotator cuff muscles play a key role in maintaining shoulder stability and a fluid motion.

The legs
The kick in freestyle is known as the flutter kick, an alternating motion with straight or slightly bent legs. Though not the main source of propulsion, a well-timed and consistent kick improves balance, reduces drag and maintains horizontal body position. The kick can be split in two movements: the downbeat and the upbeat.
•	Downbeat (kick downward):
The quadriceps are used to extend the knee, and the hip flexors bring the thigh forward and down.
•	Upbeat (kick upward):
The hamstrings flex the knee and the gluteus maximus (glutes) helps lift the leg to the surface. The gastrocnemius and the soleus (calf muscles) are also used to maintain the ankles extended and the toes pointed.

Body position
To maintain an effective position in the water, and an effective rotation, you also need to use your abdominal muscles and your obliques. The core should be engaged during the whole stroke, but it is especially important to keep it engaged during the pull and the kick phases. You also need your lower back muscles and your hip flexors and glutes to create tension in your back which maintain your spine straight and keeps your legs close to the surface which keeps them from sinking and creating drag.
A strong core also ensures that the rotation of the body comes primarily from the shoulders, not from bending the spine.
