A power tower is a resistance-based tool that adds drag to swimming movements, forcing the body to generate greater force while maintaining technique. It works by attaching a weight system (often via pulley) to a swimmer, increasing the effort needed to propel themselves forward. Unlike traditional resistance training, power towers target sprint-specific strength and neuromuscular coordination, directly transmitting to faster swim times.
