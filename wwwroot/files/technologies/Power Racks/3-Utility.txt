Power racks are becoming an essential for swimmers training for sprint events. Firstly, it helps training to activate fast-twitch muscle fibers. Sprinters rely on fast-twitch muscle fibers, which are responsible for explosive movements like starts, turns, and surges. Power tower sets require high-intensity, short duration efforts that are usually in between 5 to 15 meters, forcing the CNS to recruit these fibers quickly and efficiently. Secondly, it helps strengthen the central nervous system. The CNS controls how quickly and efficiently the muscles fire up, which is crucial for elite-level sprinting. By engaging in high-intensity resistance work with full-force efforts, power tower training conditions the CNS to activate muscle groups faster and in an efficient matter. Finally, and most importantly, it builds explosive strength and acceleration. They are highly effective in training swimmers to explode off the blocks and walls. Because the added resistance forces greater muscular engagements, sprinters develop more powerful push-offs on starts and turns, increase their stroke propulsion with each pull of their arms, and have a higher sprint velocity in short bursts.
