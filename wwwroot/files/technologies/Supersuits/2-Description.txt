The suit is designed to cover from the ankles to the shoulders. Th zipper used to fasten the suit was facing inwards, with the teeth facing the outside of the suit. Amazingly, different composite layers could be added to the suit depending on which event the athlete was taking part in. While a suit made from a single layer could be assured of minimizing friction, that could come at the cost of being too tight around certain muscles. The answer was to customize different extra panels in specific areas, allowing for extra flexibility around muscle groups specific to certain strokes (for example breaststroke and butterfly). Finally, the LZR Pro also came with an inner corset, a separate layer of fabric stretched around the abdomen that restrict drag and provides extra support to core muscles and alleviates the effects of fatigue during races.
