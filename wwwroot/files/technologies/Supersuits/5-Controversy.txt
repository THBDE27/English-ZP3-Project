The introduction of super suits led to a dramatic decrease in swimming times, with many records set during this period still standing today. The era is often viewed as a controversial chapter in swimming history, as it raised questions about the balance between technology and athletic performance. FINA, now known as the World Aquatics, in 2009, decided to ban the use of swimsuits with polyurethane during competitions, due to the unfair advantages it gave to athletes. The rules requiring textile-only fabric suits went into effect in 2010.
