In 2009, other manufacturers like Jaked and Arena went further and made their suits entirely with polyurethane, allowing the swimmers to glide through the water even faster. 67 records were broken that year in long course meters: 43 at the World Championship in Rome, the most ever recorded. In that same year, Speedo tried to replace the now infamous full-body LZR Racer suit. Dubbed the “rubber suit”, it compressed a swimmer’s body into a streamlined tube and trapped air, adding buoyancy and reducing drag. Speedo says 98% of the medals at the 2008 Olympics were won by swimmers wearing the LZR super suit.
