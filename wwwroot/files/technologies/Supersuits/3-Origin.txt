In 2008, Speedo launched the LZR Racer suit, adding polyurethane panels to its existing design and replacing the Teflon coating in previous super suit models. They involved NASA during the testing phase using their wind tunnel to analyze the resistance of fabrics. A fluid dynamics company used to work in Formula 1 also helped in the development of the suit and finally a team of biochemists tied the whole group of workers of this new suit. The more polyurethane the suits had, the less drag they created. The result of that was 55 world records broken in that year in long course meters, 25 of those during the Beijing Olympics. The suit was marketed primarily around the American athlete Michael Phelps and was retailed at around 550$.
