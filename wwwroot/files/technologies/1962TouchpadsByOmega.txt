Before touchpads, race timing was notoriously imprecise and prone to controversy since the methods used were manual stopwatches and finish judges. Timers, often three per lane, would start their watches at the sound of the starting gun and stop them when they visually saw the swimmer finish. A panel of judges would also try to visually determine the exact finishing order. That system was flawed because human reaction time varied a lot, leading to uncertainty between timers, and close finishes often resulted in protest over the declared winner. A famous example of this was the controversy of the 1960 Rome Olympics men’s 100-meter freestyle, where the results between John Devitt of Australia and Lance Larson of the USA were highly contested due to conflicting manual times and finish judge rulings. The six judges tied visually, three for Devitt and three for Larson. The chief judge, who was not permitted to vote, cast a deciding vote for Devitt, ultimately awarding him the gold. Larson was given the silver, and both were officially tied at 55.2seconds. This controversial decision, despite video evidence favoring Larson, highlighted the inaccuracy of manual timing and forced FINA to accelerate the development of electronic touchpads to prevent further disputes. The solution to this was to have the watch company Omega to start the production of an upgraded touchpad. These touchpads were unaffected by splash and were tailored to be extremely reliable. The Omega touchpads have then made their debut on the world’s biggest stage at the 1968 Mexico City Olympic Games.
