The modern tech suits (knee skins) are advanced swimwear designed to enhance performance, made from high-tech materials that reduce drag and provide muscle compression. Tech suits are primarily made from a blend of polyamide(nylon) and Lycra (spandex). Polyamide provides comfort and durability, while Lycra offers elasticity, ensuring a snug fit that aids in muscle compression. The fabrics used in tech suits are engineered to be water-repellent, minimizing water absorption and allowing swimmers to glide through the water with less resistance. This hydrophobic property is crucial for the drag aspect. They are also constructed with minimal seams or are completely seamless, which further reduces drag and enhances the suit’s hydrodynamic profile.
