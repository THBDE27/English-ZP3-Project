They are designed to fit tightly around the body, providing compression that supports muscle groups. This compression helps improve blood circulation, reduces fatigue, and enhances muscle activation during swimming. The design of tech suits also involves advanced engineering techniques, including the use of carbon fiber rand other lightweight materials. These materials help create a streamlined shape that reduces turbulence in the water and help reduce the buildup of lactic acid in the body. Some tech suits incorporate features like internal muscle taping and carbon bands that connect muscle groups, allowing them to work more efficiently together. This technology can enhance power and speed in the water.
