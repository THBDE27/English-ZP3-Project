Swimming goggles have evolved majorly throughout our time. They date back to the 14th century, when the first recorded eye protection, used by Persian pearl divers. The goggles were made of polished tortoise shells. These “goggles” were shaped to fit over the eyes and were intended for water clarity and protection. Then, between the 16th and 18th century, Polynesian skin divers developed goggles from wood or bamboo with deep frames. They trapped air to create a clear visual field underwater, though they were not fully waterproof and were limited to looking downwards. Glass lenses were only incorporated later, after European contact. In the early 20th century, competitive long-distance swimmers, like Thomas “Bill” Burgess and Gertrude Ederle crossing the English Channel, used repurposed equipment, typically motorcycle goggles, which they sealed with materials like paraffin wax to make them somewhat watertight.
