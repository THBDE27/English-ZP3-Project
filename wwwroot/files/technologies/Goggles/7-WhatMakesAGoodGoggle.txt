There are four main categories on what to look for in a good pair of goggles. First, the fit. The goggles must be able to seal without crushing your face and they must be able to stay on even after diving off the blocks. Second, the visibility. You need to be able to have a wide field of vision to assess your opponents, the walls around you, the lane ropes without moving your head too much. Third, the anti-fog longevity. It is always good to have goggles that stay clear throughout warm-up, prelims, and finals. Lastly, their race day readiness. Sometimes, it just a matter of if this pair of goggles is worthy and ready to be worn when a best time or an Olympic spot is on the line.
