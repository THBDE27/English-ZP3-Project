Speedo has the third best goggle with the “Speedo Fastskin Hyper Elite Goggle”. They are Speedo’s elite entry with their hydro-sculpted and that signature Speedo fit. Some swimmers prefer the Speedo seal over Arena depending on their face shape and loyalty level to the brand. This model is the go-to for Speedo users, especially sprinters and Imers who need stability on turns and starts. They are worn by Elijah Winnington of Australia and Duncan Scott of Great Britain.
