Swimming was once timed by man itself. Counting this way is incredibly imprecise when it comes to competing. Once it became necessary in competitions and practice to measure and compile accurate times, they switched to using stopwatches. Although stopwatches calculate time with more decimal precision, they are still only affected by the judge’s reflexes. For the most accuracy, swimmers must be the ones to hit the timer when they get to the finish line. This is where touchpads come in. They are waterproof stopwatches that attach onto pool walls. With this technology, there is no room for human error, other than the athlete themself's.
