Bill Parkinson, a Physics professor at the University of Michigan, invented the first touchpads using pressure sensors. 
They were composed of a rubber pouch with sewn-in copper wires and insulated with silicone oil. 
Its technology was rather simple; When the pouch was compressed, the wires were flexed and changed the electrical resistance of the circuit, which would immediately stop the clock. 
Although his invention is now known to be revolutionary, it was once disfavoured by the swimming coaches, who doubted its safety and its accuracy. 
Unfortunately, Parkinson’s sensors brought up concerns like electrocution and randomness due to splashes and waves.
