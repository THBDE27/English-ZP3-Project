The modern starting blocks now used during swimming competitions and practices are permanently installed at the edge of the pool. Depending on the pool, blocks will vary in size, shape, and height off the pool deck. Some blocs are more rectangular and higher off the deck, while others might be more square and closer to the ground. Older blocks tend to be smaller. For pools with water deeper than six feet, the blocks will most likely be about 29 inches above the water’s surface. For pools between 4-6 feet deep, the blocks will be about 18 inches from the surface. They often feature a non-slip surface and may include adjustable height to accommodate different swimmers. Below the block, there are also handles for the backstroke starts.
