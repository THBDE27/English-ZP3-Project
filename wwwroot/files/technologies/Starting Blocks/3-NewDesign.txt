A major turning point occurred in 2008 when the International Swimming Federation (FINA) approved the use of angled wedges at the back of starting blocks. This design change allowed swimmers to position their rear leg on the wedge, like a sprinter’s start in track and field, providing a more powerful launch into the water. These wedges are adjustable so that the swimmer can play with different placements to see what feels best. At the same time, side handles were approved offering another surface area to pull against for more propulsion.
