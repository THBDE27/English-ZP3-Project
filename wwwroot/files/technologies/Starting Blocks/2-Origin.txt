The use of diving blocks in competitive swimming began to take shape around the 1963 Olympics in Berlin, where swimmers first had the advantage of starting from an elevated platforms instead of the pool’s edge. Initially, these blocks were basic, box-like structures that provided minimal support and stability. For several decades after the Berlin Olympics, the design of starting blocks did not see significant advancements. However, as competitive swimming, grew in popularity, the need for improved diving blocks became apparent.
