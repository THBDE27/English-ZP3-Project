(background) Léon Marchand was born in Toulouse, France on May 17th, 2002. He trained with the Dauphins de Toulouse Olympique Employes Club with his coach Nicolas Castel before moving to the United States for college where he started training for Michal Phelp’s old coach Bob Bowman. After college, he started swimming with the University of Texas’ pro-group (the Longhorns) with Bowman. He is the son of former medley swimmers Xavier Marchand and Céline Bonnet. His uncle, Christophe Marchand, is also a former freestyle swimmer. He’s an extremely versatile swimmer and competes in breaststroke, individual medley, butterfly, and freestyle events.  

(achievements) He has risen the ranks in the past few years and made himself one of the best current swimmers in the world. He is world record holder in the 200m and 400m individual medley long course, and the short course world record holder in the 200m individual medley. He is also the Olympic record holder in multiple events after a very successful run on home soil at the 2024 Paris Olympics. He became the fourth swimmer and third male swimmer in Olympic history to win four individual gold medals at a single Games after winning the 200 individual medley, 200m breaststroke, 200m butterfly, and the 400 individual medley. He was also part of the silver winning team during the men’s 4x100m medley relay.  

(collegiate years) He started his collegiate years at the Arizona State University and competed on the NCAA circuit with the Sun Devils swim team. During the 2022 NCAA Division 1 Men’s Swimming and Diving Championships, he won NCAA titles in the 200-yard breastroke and the 200-yard individual medley. In 2023, he won titles in the same events as the previous year with the addition of the 400-yard individual medley. 2024 was his last year before officially going pro and he won the 200-yard breastroke, the 500-yard freestyle ad the 400-yard individual medley. He won with his college swim team the NCAA championship title for the first time ever that year.  

(2023 World Championships) During his lead up to the 2024 Olympics, Marchand competed at the 2023 World Aquatics Championship at Fukuoka in Japan, where he set a new World record in the final of the 400m individual medley with a gold winning time of 4:02.50. The impressiveness of his feat was that the previous world record was a long-standing super suit record Michael Phelps set back in 2008. He absolutely shattered the previous record by 1.34 seconds (previous record: 4:03.84).  

(the intrigue) What makes Marchand so impressive is his versatility and his meticulous race elements. He is an incredible multi-faced swimmer who can swim a wide range of events and is able to excel in a lot of them. He can push himself and keep himself technically accountable during the hardest parts of his events, pushing his underwater streamline to the brink of the 15m limit, pushing off the walls hard during turns, and holding his pace in the last lap of a race.
