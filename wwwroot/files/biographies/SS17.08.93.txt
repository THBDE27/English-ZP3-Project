(Introduction) Sarah Fredrika Sjöström was born in Salem, Sweden on August 17th, 1993. She trained with the Södertörns SS swimming club and was trained by Johan Wallberg. She has established herself as one of the greatest female sprinters of all time, dominating the sprint distances of freestyle and butterfly. She is one of the most decorated female swimmers of all time and the first Swedish woman to win an Olympic gold medal is swimming.

(Title achievements) To date, she has won 15 individual world titles across the 50m freestyle, 100m freestyle, 50m butterfly, and 100m butterfly. She is also the long course World Record holder in the 50m freestyle (23.67), 100m freestyle (51.71), and 100m butterfly (55.48). As of 2024, Sjöström has won a total of 23 individual medals at long course World Championships, more than any other swimmer in history. She was the first swimmer to win five consecutive individual medals at a single FINA World Aquatics Championships, a feat she accomplished in 2019.

(Olympic achievements) She made her senior swimming debut at the 2008 Beijing Olympic games at the age of 14 and smashes the 100m butterfly world record with a time of 56.06 en route to the gold medal spot at the 2009 World Championships. After failing to medal in London in 2012, she bounced back in style to win her nation’s first ever female Olympic swimming title, the 100m butterfly, at the 2016 Rio Olympic games. She also demonstrated amazing versatility in Brazil, taking home a silver and a bronze medal. In 2022, she became the first swimmer representing a country in Europe to win 10 individual World Championships gold medals. She has participated in five consecutive Olympic Games, from Beijing in 2008 through Paris in 2024. She has won six Olympic medals: three gold (100m butterfly, 100m freestyle, 50m freestyle), two silver (200m freestyle and 50m freestyle) and one bronze (100m freestyle).

(What makes her so good) Her success in swimming can be attributed to several key factors. She is very conscious of her technique and timing in the pool. The level of effort needed during training sessions is crucial to her sprint focused training. She pays attention to how her training feels and adjusts accordingly. She has also successfully found a balance between intensity and recovery to avoid burnout while still pushing herself to improve. Finally, she has an incredible challenger mindset. Her desire to challenge herself and push her limits has been a driving force in her career. She has taken multiple individual events at the World Championships, demonstrating her commitment and resilience to staying competitive. She is often praised for her incredible mental strength, which was on full display at the Tokyo 2020, when she secured 50m freestyle silver just before the Games.

(Technical elements) What makes her technique so eye-catching is her unique stroke and speed. Her butterfly stroke is often described as “easy” due to her precise and controlled movements, which allow her to maintain a fast pace and achieve impressive times. Her kick is also relatively small compared to other swimmers, which minimizes resistance and keeps her body streamlined during starts and turns.
