(Introduction) Gretchen Walsh was born in Tennessee, USA on January 29th, 2003. She swam for the Nashville Aquatic Club and now specialises in freestyle and butterfly events. She attended the University of Virginia and was apart of the UVA Cavaliers. After her graduation, she joined their pro-group and continued training under the guidance of Todd Desorbo. She swims alongside her sister Alex Walsh. 

(Achievements) She is the world record holder in the 100m butterfly, 4x100 medley relay, and the 4x100m mixed medley relay. In the short course format, she holds records in the 50-100 butterfly and 100m individual medley. She won the silver medal in the 100m butterfly at the 2024 Summer Olympic Games in Paris, where she also set the Olympic record in the 100m butterfly in the semifinals with a time of 55.38. She additionally holds one junior world record in the mixed gender 4x100m relay event, as well as American records in the short course format: the 50m butterfly, 4x100m freestyle relay, 4x100medley relay, 50m backstroke, and 50m freestyle. In the yards format she holds records in the 50-100y butterfly, 100y backstroke, 100y butterfly, 4x50y freestyle relay, 4x50y medley relay, 4x100y freestyle relay, and 4x100y medley relay. 

(College career) She competed collegiately in the fall of 2021 until May of 2025. In 2022, she became the fastest female freshman to swim the 50-yard freestyle in the NCAA with a time of 20.95 seconds and earned the NCAA title in the 100-yard freestyle, with a time of 46.06 seconds. She won 25 total NCAA event championships throughout her college years (9 individual events and 16 relay events). She is known to be one of the best, if not the best collegiate athlete in the past couple of years. 

(2024 Olympic trials) At the 2024 United States Olympic trials in June of 2024, Walsh set a new world record in the long course 100m butterfly with a time of 55.18, breaking the former world record of Sarah Sjöeström set at the 2016 Summer Olympics. Whilst she had set multiple American and NCAA records up to this point in short course yards, this performance marked her first ever American or world record in the long course meters format. 

(Paris 2024) She attended her first Olympic Games in Paris in 2024 where she won 2 gold medals and two silver medals. She won gold in the 4x100 medley relay, helping set a world record of 3:49.63 by swimming the butterfly split of 55.03, and the 4x100 mixed medley relay where the team also set a world record of 3:37.43. She won a silver in the 4x100 freestyle relay and in the 100m butterfly. 

(Unique anatomy) She is known for being one of the current fastest sprinters in the world and for her unique technique. She stands at a height of 6ft1in (1.85m) and has a wingspan is of 6ft4in (1.93m). Those two biological elements are quite advantageous, giving her a further reach distance in her strokes and lets her pull more water. She has hyperextended knees, which lets her create a bigger amplitude in her dolphin kicks during butterfly and underwaters. This flexibility helps her avoid drag and move in a more efficient matter. Her hyperextended elbows also give her the ability to have a better catch phase in her strokes which helps her pull more water to move forward faster. 

(Swimming technique) Her butterfly visually looks more on the stiffer side due to her arms and head position, but it works for her since it compensates for her flexibility. Her freestyle technique is more of a “straight-arm” freestyle due to her specialisation in sprinting distances.
