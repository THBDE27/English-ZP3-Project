She stands at a height of 6ft1in (1.85m) which gives her a great advantage in the pool by having a longer reach. 
Her wingspan is of 6ft4in (1.93m) giving her a better pulling strength and reach, which also optimizes her propulsion ability. 
She has hyperextended knees, which gives her a bigger amplitude and more flexibility in her kicks, which reduces drag. 
Her hyperextended elbows also give her the ability to have a better catch phase in her strokes which helps her pull more water to move forward faster.
